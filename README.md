A repository of various [Katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-intro) that
can be used to hone Java programming skills.

These Katas include various home-grown exercises, together with exercises
collated from other sites such as [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).  Note that,
in some cases, tests from other sites may have been changed for various reasons
(e.g. to standardise on Junit assertions with Hamcrest matchers).

Each Kata is stored in a separate package.  Unit tests for the kata are
provided in the [src/test/java](src/test/java) source tree.  A dummy
implementation is provided in the corresponding package in the
[src/main/java](src/main/java) source tree.  This implementation is sufficient
to allow the unit tests to compile, but all tests will fail.

Solutions to the exercises are not intended to be checked into this
repository at this stage.
