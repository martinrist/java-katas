A repository of various [Katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-intro) that
can be used to hone Java programming skills.

These Katas include various home-grown exercises, together with exercises
collated from other sites such as [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

Each Kata consists of a separate package in the [src/main/java](src/main/java)
source tree, that contains a README file detailing the Kata.  Unit tests are
provided in the corresponding package in the [src/test/java](src/test/java)
source tree.
